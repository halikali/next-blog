# Next.js Blog Website
This project is a simple blog website sample, study made to understand the working logic of next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Tech Stack

- React
- Next
- **CMS** - [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)
- SCSS
- CSS Modules


## Demo

The design of this blog site is a code version of a design file I found on Figma. A few minor changes have been made.
